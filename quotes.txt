Responsive is better than fast
It’s not fully shipped until it’s fast
Anything added dilutes everything else
Practicality beats purity
Approachable is better than simple
Mind your words, they are important
Speak like a human
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
Encourage flow
Non-blocking is better than blocking
Favor focus over features
Avoid administrative distraction
Design for failure
Keep it logically awesome
I’m not picky, I just have standards.
Me chasing you? Bitch, Read it backward.
If you want to shine like a sun, First you have to burn like a sun.
This is my life, Not yours don’t worry about what I do.
Can not trust anyone these days, fake is becoming the new trend.
It is not an attitude. It is the way I am.
I don’t race, I don’t chase that’s why I can’t be replaced.
The harder I work, the luckier I get.
You don’t know this new me, I put back my pieces differently.
I’m not afraid of storms, for I’m learning to sail my ship.
I don’t know where I am going, but I’m on my way.
I don’t have an attitude problem, I just carry a personality you can’t handle.
I’m worth it. Always was, and always will be.
My life, My choices, My mistakes, My lessons, Not your business.
I don’t dislike my haters, they dislike me. I’m doing nothing wrong, I’m just being me.
Give me respect, dammit, or get damaged.
The question isn’t who’s going to let me; it’s who’s going to stop me.
